Every answer above works fine, but when the server or dev-machine is restarted, we need to make all steps again and again. 
To solve completely, we can put this attibute 'derived_merge=OFF' in the mysql configuration. 
Ok, to do that, you need to access your MySQL server with de MySQL Workbench, 
and open "Option File" > Select Performance tab. In Optimizer group, look for optimizer_switch, 
click the checkbox to enable a field, and put 'derived_merge=OFF'. 
Restart your server in services.msc
